# Typesketch
Typesketch is a simple program for typography design.

There are three main modes:

-GridMode allows for creation of straight lines.

-SketchMode allows for creation of curves.

-FinetuneMode is not implemented, but it would allow for adjustment of outlines of previously created shapes.

A special mode, ghostMode, allows for a shadow of the letter tab to be displayed.

A bug that still exists is if the user drags to fill but releases the mouse on top of an object, the drag-to-fill function breaks.  The same bug exists when the user drags the eraser over an object.  I have made temporary fixes to these bugs by resetting drag variables when the user clicks on the pencil or eraser icon.  

Typesketch is my first javascript project.  Please enjoy!  Check it out here: http://vverovvero.github.io/Typesketch/

Typesketch was an idea developed by David Handsman and me.  The inspiration was David's idea to create a grid-based type design system.  The user interface design is attributed to David.  I coded the project to life.
