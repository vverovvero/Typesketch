# typesketch
TypeSketch is a simple program for typography design.

There are three main modes:
-GridMode allows for creation of straight lines.
-SketchMode allows for creation of curves.
-FinetuneMode is not implemented, but it would allow for adjustment of outlines of previously created shapes.

A special mode, ghostMode, allows for a shadow of the letter tab to be displayed.

A bug that still exists is if the user drags to fill but releases the mouse on top of an object, the drag-to-fill function breaks.
I am not sure how to fix this bug.

TypeSketch is my first javascript project.  Please enjoy!
